## How to use?
#### Not as easy as you thought
Due to the security reasons there can be troubles with opening [**index.html**](https://github.com/NervousVoid/interactive_map/blob/master/index.html) offline.  
So I advise you to run an Apache server with [**XAMPP**](https://www.apachefriends.org).  
  
>## How to run a server?
>1. Clone this repo into *../xampp/htdocs/*
>2. Press **"Start"** button next to **"Apache"** in XAMPP Control Panel
>3. In browser got to *localhost/interactive_map/index.html*
>3. **You are perfect!**
